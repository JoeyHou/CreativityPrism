# CS-4---Creative-Writing-Benchmark
This repository contains the CS4 Benchmark Dataset, designed to evaluate the creativity and narrative coherence of large language models (LLMs) under varying levels of story-writing constraints. This dataset challenges LLMs to generate stories with increasing prompt specificity, enhancing our understanding of LLMs' capability to produce original and coherent narratives.

**Contents**  
**Story-based Constraints:** These constraints are derived from human-written stories from the [Writing Prompts dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ratthachat/writing-prompts).  
**Instruction-based Constraints:** These constraints are generated from specific thematic instructions given to GPT-4 along with few-shot examples.
