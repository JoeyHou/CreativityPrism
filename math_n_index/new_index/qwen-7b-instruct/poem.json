O'er tranquil waters I do stray, To gaze upon the vast expanse, And let my thoughts and spirit sway, As I inhale the salty dance. The waves they ebb and flow so free, A constant ebb and flow, To life's melody, A symphony, a rhythm, A dance of life, come what may. The seagulls cry their cheerful cheer, A melody of nature's might, While waves dance on and overhead, The stars and moon put on a sight. So let me walk and let me dream, On this vast and wondrous sea, For in its depths and in its stream, I find the peace I cannot be. And as the day begins to fade, And night descends with starry light, I'll hold this moment in my head, And dream of the ocean's might. For in its vast and boundless might, I find my heart's true resting place, A place of peace, of endless sight, Where I can be, and just embrace. Swiftly walk o'er the western wave, The ocean breeze doth softly crave, And sun",

They carry the weight of a world, where violence whispers and war implores. Innocent lives, brutally torn, by bombs that destroy and terrify. \n\nYet, amidst the ruins and the tears, a fragile peace we must adhere. The whispers of the fallen, guiding us to mend and strive, To honor their sacrifice, in a world that's dark, yet slowly lights the skies. \n\nFor every tear shed, every blood spilt, a promise to stand, to not yield, To remember, to protect, to fight for the right. War's a joke for me and you, But let us be guardians, not to mock, but to ensure, no more tears, no more sorrow and no more sorrow. \n\nSo let this be our vow, a silent, steadfast resolve, To cherish peace, and to end war's joke, with a future where the past is not a quote, but a lesson, a path to grow",

As the night's cool breath begins to set, The dragonflies prepare to leave their abode, Their silken threads of silk and light, A treasure to be treasured, a secret to be left, For those who watch and wonder, in awe and delight. As king fishers catch fire, dragonflies draw flame, A dance of nature, a celebration of the same, A moment to be cherished, a fleeting glimpse of wonder, A reminder of the beauty that's always closer. So let us pause, and take a breath, And savor the magic, a gift from the earth, For in this dance of light and shadow, We find a beauty that will never go away. For in the end, it's not the destination, but the journey, That leaves a mark on our hearts, and in our dreams, A reminder of the magic that's always here, Waiting to be discovered, in the",
