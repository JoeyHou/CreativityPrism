The sun had set, casting a warm, golden glow On the water's surface, as the stars began to show. The air was filled with the scent of blooming flowers, As we sat together, in the quiet of the hours. You served a feast of delicacies, a culinary delight, With wine and laughter, on that peaceful, summer night. The world seemed to slow down, as we drifted with the tide, Our conversation flowing, like the river, side by side. In that serene and idyllic setting, our hearts felt free, As we connected, wild and carefree, you and me.
