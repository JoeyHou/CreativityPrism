In 1524, the Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano was the first European to visit the area, and in 1614, the English explorer Thomas Hunt mapped the coastline.\nIn 1636, Roger Williams, an English theologian and settler, established the colony of Providence, which would eventually become the capital of Rhode Island. Williams, who had been banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony for his views on separation of church and state, was attracted to the area's scenic beauty and fertile soil.\nIn 1637, the colony of Newport was established, and in 1644, the town of Portsmouth was settled. Over the next several decades, the colony of Rhode Island grew and prospered, becoming a major center for trade and commerce.\nIn 1663, the English monarch Charles II granted a charter to the colony, establishing it as a separate entity",
