This can be generalized as follows:\n\nAfter the $n^{th}$ pouring, the fraction of water remaining is $\\frac{1}{n+1}$.\n\nWe want to find the number of pourings $n$ such that the fraction of water remaining is $\\frac{1}{10}$.\n\nSetting up the equation, we have $\\frac{1}{n+1} = \\frac{1}{10}$.\n\nSolving for $n$, we get $n+1 = 10$, which implies $n = 9$.\n\nTherefore, the number of pourings required to have exactly one tenth of the original water remaining is $\\boxed{9}$.\n\nThis solution is distinct from the given ones as it uses a different approach, focusing on the relationship between the fraction of water remaining and the number of pourings, rather than the product of fractions or the arithmetic sequence of numerators."
